# PIXELLE — Portable Photo Sticker Printer website

Agency project: an 18-page website for **PIXELLE Snap**, built in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 and one vanilla JS file (`scrolling-animation.js`).

## Before you submit
1. **Site URL**: replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` in `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` and the `<link rel="canonical">` tags (search & replace across files).
2. **Store links**: Shopee/Lazada buttons point to marketplace searches; swap in real store URLs if you have them.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a public repository, e.g. `pixelle`.
2. *Add file → Upload files*: drag in **the contents of this folder** (`index.html` must be at the root, plus `style.css`, `scrolling-animation.js` and the `images` folder). Commit.
3. *Settings → Pages*: Source **Deploy from a branch**, Branch **main**, folder **/ (root)**, Save.
4. About a minute later the site is live at `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/pixelle/`.

Note: file names are case-sensitive on GitHub Pages (`Specs.html` has a capital S, matching the links).

**PIXELLE Club pop-up:** first-time visitors see a 10%-off member sign-up 6 seconds after answering the cookie banner (never on cart, checkout, payment, acknowledgement or PDPA pages). Closing it hides it for 7 days; a "10% OFF" tab reopens it. Code **PIXELCLUB10** works in the cart. To test it again, clear the site's data in your browser.

**Demo data:** the "people viewing now" and "sold" counters and per-colour stock levels on the Purchase page are simulated for this prototype. On a live store they must come from real analytics and inventory, since fake scarcity or social proof would be misleading under Singapore's Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.

**Accounts:** log in and sign up are a demo. No account is created and passwords are never stored or sent; only a first name is kept in the browser to greet the member.

The cart is stored in the visitor's own browser (localStorage). Forms validate and show a confirmation, but nothing is sent or stored. The payment page is a clearly marked demo.
